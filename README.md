Match Box is a vibrant card game created assembled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

This is the orginal WireFrame for the game. As I started developing I made some changes.

Final product: 
When the User loads the page the cards are not displayed. The user must press the Start Game button to begin.

If the user manages to match all the cards, the score will be displayed with the message "YOU WON!"

My MVP Goals for this Game:
As the player loads the page, the start button is displayed and I want the user to press the button so that they can start the game (specifically the timer)
As the player starts to flip the cards, I want the game to track the flips so that I can track the score. The player who flips all the cards with the least amount of flips has a higher score.

User Story: 
The user clicks the start game button to start the game. 
The user can now flip any two cards to match them while the timer is going. 
Matchbox is also tracking the number of flips the user makes to calculate the score when the timer ends. 
If the user manages to match all the cards before the timer ends, Matchbox will display the score of the user. 
If the user does not manage to match all the cards before the timer, Matchbox will display in the score section: Lost Game.
